Natural language processing refers to the branch of computer science and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI, concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to understand its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer's intent and sentiment.
